\section{Evaluation}
•	What went well and what went badly?  
•	Why was this the case?  
•	To what extent was the aspect under consideration responsible (vs. other contributing factors, e.g., your own performance).
•	Was your experience in line with what might have been expected given the body of knowledge within the literature?
•	To what extent does the above cause you to reconsider the choices that you made in relation to the given aspect?

\section{Conclusion}
It is a brief summary of the project and its achievements. Therefore, you should relist your project’s objectives and critically (and ruthlessly) evaluate whether you met the objectives
