what cant be included as it isnt get parsed:
	Anonymous objects such as
	"""
	gridObjects:
		tileName: [ obj1, obj2, { id: anon, data: { id: 1 } } ]
	"""

//notes on whats currently the limitations of the software is
practices to use when useing the editor:
-all object definitions should be defined in an external yaml
	in level obj def might work but will have to double check, and could break the objs definiton(keep it simple if doing so)
-if opening a compatiable level make sure all tile definitions are in the level file and not external

-dont use Anonymous object in tile definitions 
	Anonymous creates uncertinty on what could be included within the object and whether it should be saved back as Anonymous or become a defined object
-dont pass data to mods, not supported and wont load level
	same as above, i becomnes difficult to parse as there isnt a define format for what could be inside
